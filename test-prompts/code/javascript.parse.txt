Help me write a Javascript function to parse data from this model.info.txt file:

- in the Model section, each line is in format "name    value"
  - for each line, save as a javascript variable: name="$value" 
  - example:  line "architecture        granite" parses to: architecture="granite"
 
- in the Capabilities section, each line is a single keyword
  - save all the keywords into a javascript array

- in the System section, single or multiple lines showing the system prompt
  - save as var $systemPrompt

- In the Parameters section (has same format as Model section)
  - only save the 'temperature' value

- Allow that any section or any line may be missing
